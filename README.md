👋 Hi, I’m Amilcar Pio

Full-Stack Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend systems, working with Node.js, TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#. I design and implement scalable APIs, distributed services, and event-driven architectures, and I have practical experience building RAG and LLM-powered features.

On the frontend, I work comfortably with React, Angular, Vue.js, and Svelte, always prioritizing maintainability and consistency across the stack. My background includes integrations with third-party platforms, secure data workflows, and cloud-native development on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

I care about clean engineering practices, clear communication, and building solutions that developers enjoy maintaining and extending.
